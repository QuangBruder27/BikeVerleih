Thesis for obtaining the academic degree B.Sc. at the HTW Berlin in the course of studies Applied Computer Science

Bike rental systems offer customers the option of renting a bike when using a mobile application. Along the way, customers can earn bonus points if they report defective
bikes or if the distance traveled is more than 5 km. This bachelor thesis deals with the development of bicycle rental systems consisting of a backend server, a mobile
application for customers and a mobile application for bicycles.
